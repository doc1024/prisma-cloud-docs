=== Description 


This policy ensures that port 22 is not exposed in Dockerfiles. Exposing port 22 in Docker containers can pose security risks by allowing unauthorized users to gain SSH access to the container. Instead, you should avoid exposing port 22 and use more secure methods for managing and accessing your containers.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Docker* 

To mitigate this issue, remove any EXPOSE instructions related to port 22. Consider using more secure alternatives to SSH for managing your containers.

Example:

[source,dockerfile]
----
- EXPOSE 22 + # Do not expose port 22
...
----
