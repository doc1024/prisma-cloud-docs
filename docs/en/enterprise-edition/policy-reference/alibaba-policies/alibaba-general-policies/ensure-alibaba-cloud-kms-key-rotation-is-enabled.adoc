=== Description

A key is a named object representing a cryptographic key used for specific purposes, such as data protection and encryption. The key material—the actual bits used for encryption—can change over time as new key versions are generated. A single key can be used to encrypt multiple files, and individuals with decrypt permissions for that key can decrypt those files.

To enhance security, it is recommended to set a key rotation period. Key rotation involves automatically generating new key versions at a specified interval, ensuring that the encryption remains robust and limiting the exposure time of any compromised key material. A key can be configured with a specified rotation period or a next rotation time, defining when new key versions should be created.

=== Fix - Buildtime


*Terraform* 

* *Resource:* alicloud_kms_key
* *Arguments:* automatic_rotation

To mitigate this issue, ensure the `automatic_rotation` attribute of the `alicloud_kms_key` resource is set to `Enabled`.

Example:

[source,go]
----
resource "alicloud_kms_key" "example" {
  ...
+  automatic_rotation = "Enabled"
}
----
