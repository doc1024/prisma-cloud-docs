== Manage Third-Party Ingested Data

By ingesting Static Application Security Testing (SAST) findings directly from third-party sources, Application Security expands its security coverage, allowing you to gain visibility into and effectively manage SAST violations across your organization. The platform also provides suggested remediation steps to help you quickly address identified vulnerabilities. These capabilities, combined with Application Security's native IaC, SCA and Secrets scanner management and other domains, provide a comprehensive security management platform for your applications.

NOTE: SAST scans analyze the source code of an application to identify security vulnerabilities, coding errors, and weaknesses. SAST CWE violations refer to security vulnerabilities identified by SAST tools that align with the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list. Refer to the https://cwe.mitre.org/[MITRE CWE website] for more information about CWEs.

Before you begin, integrate your third party data sources to ingest SAST data findings. Refer to ../../get-started/connect-code-and-build-providers/third-party-ingestion/third-party-ingestion.adoc[Third_Party Ingestion] for more information.

To access third-party ingested SAST data issue management, in *Application Security*, select *Projects* > *3rd Party Weaknesses* tab.

For information on mitigating SAST issues, refer to xref:fix-code-issues.adoc[Fix Code Security Issues]. 

For more information on SAST scan management on *Prisma Cloud console*, refer to xref:monitor-and-manage-code-build.adoc[Monitor and Manage Code Build Issues].
