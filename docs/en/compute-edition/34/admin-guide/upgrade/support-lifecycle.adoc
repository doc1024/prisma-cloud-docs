==  Support lifecycle for connected components

To simplify upgrades, older versions of Defenders, Jenkins plugins, and twistcli can interoperate with newer versions of Console.
With this capability, you have a larger window to plan upgrades for connected components.


=== Window of Support

Any supported version of Defender, twistcli, and the Jenkins plugin can connect to Console.
Prisma Cloud supports the latest release and the previous two releases (n, n-1, and n-2).

With the v34.00 release, the Defender versions supported (n, n-1, and n-2) are v34.00, v33.xx, and v32.xx
respectively. In addition, continuing from the release 33.00, Prisma Cloud does not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from the n-3 version. So the current release will allow Defenders and REST API calls from release 31.xx also. However, to maintain full support, you must upgrade your Defenders to v32.xx or a higher release. 

Failure to upgrade Defenders below version v31.00, such as v30.xx, will result in disconnection of the Defenders from the Console. 

To summarize, the level of support for the different versions of Defenders is as follows:

* Defender versions 34.00, 33.xx, and 32.xx have full support.
* Defender versions 31.xx are functional (will be able to connect to version 34.xx Console) but support is not available for such Defenders.
* Defender versions previous to 31.xx, such as 30.xx, are neither supported nor functional (cannot connect to version 34.xx Console).

=== Defender's Connection Status

Defender's connection status on the Defender management page indicates how it interoperates with Console. Defenders that match Console's version show the status of Connected. Defenders still supported, but running a previous version, show the connected status with a message that upgrade is available (but not mandatory).

Twistcli and the Jenkins plugin function as normal, with an indication in the scan reports in the Console that an upgrade is available.

=== End of Support

With Prisma Cloud release 34.00, version 30.xx and earlier are not supported. Such Defenders cannot connect to the Console and will be listed with a Connection status of *Disconnected* on the Defender management page.  

Versions 30.xx and earlier of twistcli and Jenkins plugin fail to open. Their requests to Console are refused, but builds will pass. Console returns a status of 400 Bad Request, which indicates an error due to the fact that the plugin version is no longer supported.
