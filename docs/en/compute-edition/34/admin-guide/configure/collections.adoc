== Collections

Collections are predefined filters for segments of your environment. They are centrally defined, and they are used in rules and views across the product.

Collections are used to:

* Scope rules to target specific resources in your environment.
+
Example: A vulnerability rule that applies to all container images in an app called sock-shop. The rule might reference a collection, which specifies `sock-shop` in the image resource filter.

* Partition views to provide a convenient way to browse data from related resources.

* Enforce which views that specific users and groups can see by controlling access to data on a need-to-know basis (assigned collections).

=== Attributes Used for Pattern Matching
Collections are created with xref:../configure/rule-ordering-pattern-matching.adoc[pattern matching] expressions that are evaluated against attributes such as 
* Image name
* Container name
* Hostname
* Labels
* Function name
* Namespace
* Registry tag

For labels, Prisma Cloud supports AWS tags and distro attributes.

=== Supported Distro Attributes

Distro attributes are designed for central security teams that manage the policies in Console, but have little influence over the operational practices of the groups that run apps in the environments being secured.
If the central security team can't rely on naming conventions or labels to apply policies that are OS-specific (for example, different compliance checks for different operating systems), they can leverage the distro attributes.
Supported distro attributes are:

* Distro name. The format is `osDistro:<value>`. Example: `osDistro:Ubuntu`
* Distro version. The format is `osVersion:<value>`. Example: `osVersion:20.04`.

=== Partitioning Views

A single Console manages data from Defenders spread across all hosts. Collections allow you to segment data into different views, based on attributes.

==== Example Use Case

A Kubernetes cluster runs multiple apps:

* *Shopping app* (managed by the product team)
* *Travel app & Expenses app* (managed by an internal tools team)

A developer for the travel app only needs to see vulnerabilities in the travel app images. Collections filter out unnecessary data, reducing noise and improving focus.

=== Scoping Rules

The scope of a rule is defined by referencing the relevant collections. Collections offer a centralized way to manage scope settings across Prisma Cloud.
Collections ensure consistency across policies as they allow reuse of scope settings. Policy tables give you a clear picture of what resources are being targeted in your rules.

image::collections_policy_table_scopes.png[width=800]

When creating new rules, you can either select from a list of previously defined collections or create a new one. By default, Prisma Cloud sets a rule's scope to the *All* collection, which captures all resources in the environment.

image::collections_rule_scope.png[width=700]


Example: You can create collections based on different attributes, such as application names or namespaces. Additionally, collections can be created based on regions.
For example, you can define a collection that includes all resources in the us-west-1 region, allowing you to scope policies specifically for resources deployed in that region.


=== Importing and exporting rules

Rules can be exported from one Console and imported into another Console. When importing rules, any associated collections are also imported and created.

Prisma Cloud allows rules and collections to be imported/exported between Consoles.

=== Import Behavior

[options="header"]
|===
| Scenario | Action Taken
| Collection does not exist in the new Console | Created automatically
| Collection exists but has a different scope | New collection is created with:  
  * *Name:* `<policyType> - <ruleName> <collectionName>`  
  * *Description:* `Automatically generated collection for an imported rule/entity`
| Collection exists with a matching scope | Existing collection is used as-is
|===

=== Creating Collections

You can create as many collections as you like. However, collections **cannot be nested**.

==== Built-in Collections
Prisma Cloud ships with a built-in collection called *All*, which:
- Is **not editable**.
- Contains **all objects in the Prisma Cloud**.
- Functions as a wildcard (`*`) for all resource types, including containers, images, hosts, labels, and more.

==== Where to Create Collections
Collections can be created from:
- *Manage > Collections and Tags > Collections*  
- The *New Rule* dialog when setting a rule’s scope  
  - In this case, Prisma Cloud **disables irrelevant scope fields**.  
  - If you select a previously defined collection in a rule’s scope field, **improperly scoped collections are hidden** (e.g., a collection specifying serverless functions won’t be shown in a container runtime rule).  

==== Default Collection Scope
By default, new collections set a wildcard (`*`) for each resource type, capturing **all resources**. To refine the scope, customize the relevant fields.

==== Supported Labels
The *Labels* field supports multiple sources, including:

[options="header"]
|===
| Label Type | Supported Sources  
| *https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/[Docker labels]* | Container metadata  
| *Azure Registry Tags* | Key-value pairs (`key:value`)  
| *Kubernetes Labels* | Pod template, namespace, and deployment labels  
| *AWS Tags* | Tags associated with cloud resources  
| *Distribution Name for Hosts* | `osDistro:<name>`  
| *Operating System Version for Hosts* | `osVersion:<version>`  
|===

==== Using Registry Tags for Access Control  
- Prisma Cloud extracts **registry tags from Azure Registry**.  
- These tags can be used to enforce **role-based access control (RBAC)** for vulnerability scan findings.  
- All identified Azure registry tags appear under:  
  *Monitor > Vulnerabilities > Images > Registries > Image Details > Labels*  

==== Enabling Additional Label Support  
To use additional labels, enable the corresponding settings:

[options="header"]
|===
| Label Type | Configuration Path  
| *Kubernetes Namespace and Deployment Labels* | Enable under *Manage > Defenders > Deployed Defenders > Manual Deploy > Collect Deployment and Namespace Labels*  
| *AWS Tags for Hosts* | Enable VM tags in *Manage > Cloud Accounts > Add/Edit Account > Discovery Features*  
|===  

==== Scoping App-Embedded Policy Rules  
To scope App-Embedded **vulnerability, compliance, and runtime rules**, use the collection’s **App ID field**.

For *Fargate tasks* protected by App-Embedded Defenders, rules can additionally be scoped by **image**.

==== Collection Scope Limitations  
Certain resource combinations are **not allowed in a single collection**:

[options="header"]
|===
| Combination | Restriction  
| *Host + Cluster* | Must separate into distinct collections.  
| *Container + Image* | One field must use a wildcard (`*`), or the collection won't apply correctly.  
|===  

*Example:*  
To apply collections to both a container and an image, create **two separate collections**:
- One collection should include **only the container name**.
- The other collection should include **only the image name**.
- **Filtering on both collections simultaneously won’t yield the desired result**.

==== Unsupported Filtering  
- Filtering by **cloud account ID** for *Azure Container Instances* is **not supported**.

==== Steps to Create a Collection

To create a collection, follow these steps:

. Open Console
.. Navigate to *Manage > Collections and Tags > Collections*.

. Add a New Collection
.. Click *Add Collection*.

. Enter Collection Details
.. *Name:* Provide a unique name for the collection.  
.. *Description:* (Optional) Enter a description to define its purpose.  
.. *Color:* Choose a color to visually distinguish this collection.  

. Choose Resources to include. Select one or more of the following resources:
* *Containers* – Running container instances in your environment.
* *Hosts* – Physical or virtual machines where containers run.
* *Images* – Container images stored in registries.
+
NOTE: Other than the image name, the system also checks the text you type against the operating system, ID, the hostname, and the cluster name. Successful matches on any of these properties will result in the corresponding image being displayed. 

* *Labels* – Key-value metadata attached to resources.
* *App IDs (App-embedded)* – Application identifiers for embedded security enforcement.
* *Functions* – Serverless functions such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.
* *Namespaces* – Isolated environments in Kubernetes.

+
For more information on syntax that can be used in the filter fields (for example, containers, images, and hosts), see xref:../configure/rule-ordering-pattern-matching.adoc#[Rule ordering and pattern matching].

. Define Filters. Use pattern-matching syntax to refine the scope.
+
*Example:* To select all images that start with "raspberry", use the filter *raspberry*

. Save the Collection
.. Click *Save* to apply your settings. 
+
You can view a summary of each Collection in the sidecar, which shows the resources' data and usage of the Collection

image::collection-sidecar-view.png[width=300]

The new collection will now be available for use in rules and views. 

ifdef::compute_edition[]
=== Assigned collections

Collections provide a lightweight mechanism to provision least-privilege access to the resources in your environment.
You can assign collections to specific users and groups to limit their view of data and resources in the environment.

NOTE: Projects are the other mechanism for partitioning your environment.
Projects are Prisma Cloud's solution for multi-tenancy.
They let you provision multiple independent environments, and federate them behind a single Console URL, interface, and API.
Projects take more effort to deploy than collections.
Collections and Projects can work together.
Collections can be utilized in both non-Project and Project-enabled environments. 

By default, users and groups can access all collections and are not assigned with any collection.

Users with admin or operator roles can always see all resources in the system.
They can also see all collections, and utilize them to filter views.
When creating users or groups with the admin or operator role, there is no option for assigning collections.

When creating users or groups with any other role, admins can optionally assign one more collection.
These users can only see the resources in the collections they've been assigned.

image::collections_dropdown_list.png[scale=15]

[NOTE]
====
If a user is assigned multiple system roles, either directly or through group inheritance, then the user is granted the highest role and access to the assigned collections of all the groups to which the user belongs.
If a user is assigned both system and custom roles, then the user will be randomly granted the rights of one of the groups, including its role and assigned collections.
====

You cannot delete a Collection as long as it is being used by a rule, or if a Collection is assigned to users or groups.
This enforcement mechanism ensures that the rules, users, and groups are never left stateless (unscoped).
Select a Collection to see what resource is using the Collection:

image::collections_usages.png[width=300]

NOTE: Changes to a user or group's assigned collections only take effect after users re-login.

[.task]
=== Assigning collections

Assign collections to specific users and groups to restrict their view of data in the environment.

IMPORTANT: If a role allows access to policies, users with this role will be able to see all rules and all collections that scope rules under the Defend section, even if the user’s view of the environment is restricted by assigned collections.

Collections can be assigned to local users, LDAP users, and SAML users.
Collections can also be assigned to LDAP and SAML groups.
They cannot be assigned to local groups.

When using Projects, Collections can only be assigned to users on each project. Users of the Central Console have access to all projects, and cannot be limited to assigned collections.

*Prerequisites:*

* You've already created one or more collections.
* (Optional) You've integrated Prisma Cloud with a directory service or SAML IdP.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Manage > Authentication > {Users | Groups}*.

. Click *Add users* or *Add group*.

. Select the *Auditor* or *DevOps User* role.

. In *Permissions*, select one or more collections.
If left unspecified, the default permission is *All collections*.

. Click *Save*.

endif::compute_edition[]

=== Selecting a collection

Collections filter data in the *Monitor* section of the Console.

When a collection (or multiple collections) is selected, only the objects that match the filter are shown in those views.
When a collection is selected, it remains selected for all views until it is explicitly disabled.

To select a collection, go to any view under *Monitor*.
In the Collections drop-down list in the top right of the view, select a collection.
In the following screenshot, the view is filtered based on the collection named *google images*, which shows all images that contain the string *google_containers*.

image::collections_792004.png[scale=15]

When multiple collections are selected, the effective scope is the union of each individual query.

// https://github.com/twistlock/twistlock/issues/14262
NOTE: Individual filters on each collection aren't applicable to all views.
For example, a collection created with only functions won't include any resources when viewing the hosts results.
Similarly, a collection created with hosts won't filter images by hosts when viewing image results.

The *Collections* column shows to which collection a resource belongs.
The color assigned to a collection distinguishes objects that belong to specific collections.
This is useful when multiple collections are displayed simultaneously.
Collections can also be assigned arbitrary text tags to make it easier for users to associate other metadata with a collection.

=== Use Collections with TAS Metadata Fields

Prisma Cloud automatically collects metadata fields such as Foundation, Organization Name, Application Name and ID, and Space Name and ID.
To utilize these fields, you'll have to *manually create* appropriate collections that can then be used for filtering and aggregation.

[cols="30%,40%", options="header"]
|===
|Resource type |Supported Labels


|Host
|tas-foundation

|Containers (running applications)
|tas-application-id, tas-application-name, tas-space-id, tas-space-name, tas-org-id, tas-org-name, tas-foundation

|Droplets
|tas-application-id, tas-application-name, tas-space-id, tas-space-name, tas-org-id, tas-org-name, tas-foundation

|===

* To use the *tas-fundation* label, enter a *Foundation* name in the Prisma Cloud TAS tile configuration screen at the time of xref:../install/deploy-defender/orchestrator/install-tas-defender.adoc[deploying a TAS Defender].

=== Limitations

Different views in Console are filtered by different resource types.
 
If a collection specifies resources that are unrelated to the view, filtering by this collection returns an empty result.

==== Using Collections

After collections are created or updated, the following views require a rescan before reflecting changes:

* Deployed Images vulnerabilities and compliance views
* Registry Images vulnerabilities and compliance views
* Code repositories vulnerabilities view
* Trusted images 
* Cloud Discovery
* Vulnerability Explorer
* Compliance Explorer

After collections are created or updated, some views are affected by the change only for future records.
The following views retain their collections right from the time the records are created:

* Images and Functions CI results view 
* Events views 
* Incidents view
* Image analysis sandbox results view
