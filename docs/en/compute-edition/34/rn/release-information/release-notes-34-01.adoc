[#upgrade]
=== Upgrade from Previous Releases

[#upgrade-defender]
==== Upgrade Defenders

With the `v34.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Defender releases (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v34`, `v33`, and `v32` respectively. In addition, Prisma Cloud will not restrict the usage of Defender versions or REST API calls from the n-3 releases. So the current release will allow Defenders and REST API calls from release `v31` also. Failure to upgrade Defenders below release `v31`, such as `v30.03`, will result in disconnection of the Defenders from the Console.

However, to maintain full support, you must upgrade your Defenders to a `v32.00` or a higher release.

To summarize, the level of support for the different versions of Defenders is as follows:

* Defender versions 34.xx, 33.xx, and 32.xx have full support
* Defender versions 31.xx are functional (will be able to connect to version 34.00 Console) but support is not available for such Defenders
* Defender versions previous to 31.00, such as 30.03, are neither supported nor functional (cannot connect to version 34.xx Console)


[#upgrade-console]
==== Upgrade the Prisma Cloud Console

With the `v34.00` release, the https://docs.prismacloud.io/en/compute-edition/32/admin-guide/upgrade/support-lifecycle[supported Console releases (n, n-1, and n-2)] are `v34`, `v33`, and `v32` respectively. 

NOTE: Defenders from the n-3 release will remain functional as described above. 

You can upgrade the Prisma Cloud console directly from any n-1 or n-2 version to n. For example, with `v34` as n and `v33` as n-1, you can upgrade directly from `33.01.137` to `34.00.141`. You can also upgrade directly from an n-2 version (`32.00.161`, `32.01.128`, `32.02.127`, `32.03.123`, `32.04.113`, `32.05.124`, `32.06.113`, `32.07.123`) to `34.00.141`.

//NOTE: You have to upgrade any version of `v32` to `v33` before upgrading to `v34`. For example, you can upgrade from `v32.05.124` to `v33.03.138` before you upgrade to `v34.00.141`.
