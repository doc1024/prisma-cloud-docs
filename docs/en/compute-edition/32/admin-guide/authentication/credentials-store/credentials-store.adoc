== Credentials Store

Prisma Cloud seamlessly integrates with multiple third-party services and cloud providers, ensuring robust security and operational efficiency.

To streamline credential management, the *Credentials Store* (accessible under *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*) serves as a secure repository for storing and managing authentication credentials used in integrations.

**Prisma Cloud makes a clear distinction between third-party integration credentials and cloud account credentials.**

- *Third-party credentials*—such as those used for scanning container registries, sending alerts, or managing Defender deployments—are securely stored and managed within the Credentials Store.  
- *Cloud account credentials*, however, are handled separately. They are not stored in the Credentials Store but are instead onboarded through the *Manage > Cloud Accounts* page, where Prisma Cloud manages authentication and permissions required for cloud workload protection.

=== Supported Integrations
The Credentials Store manages credentials used for:

* Scanning container registries, serverless functions, and other environments
* Sending alerts via third-party services (e.g., Slack, ServiceNow, email)
* Deploying and managing Defender DaemonSets
* Injecting secrets into running containers

The following diagram shows the architecture of the the credentials store.

=== Managing Third-Party Credentials in Credentials Store

If a credential is actively in use, it cannot be deleted. To check its usage, select an entry from the credentials table and review the *Usages* list.

You can refresh a credential’s values without deleting and reconfiguring the integration. If an integration relies on a credential and you update its parameters (e.g., username, password), Prisma Cloud automatically propagates the new values across the relevant modules.

=== Managing Cloud Account Credentials

To manage cloud account credentials, use the *Manage > Cloud Accounts* page under the **Runtime Security** component. This section handles the authentication and permissions required for cloud workload protection.
