== JIRA Alerts

Prisma Cloud continually scans your environment for vulnerabilities using the threat data in the Intelligence Stream.
Prisma Cloud can open JIRA issues when new vulnerabilities are detected in your environment.
This mechanism lets you implement continuous vulnerability assessment and remediation by hooking directly into the developer's workflow.

New JIRA issues are opened when new vulnerabilities are found.
A new issue is created for each discovery.
Each  JIRA issue lists the new vulnerabilities discovered, and a list of vulnerabilities that have already been reported but were still detected.

JIRA issues are opened based on policy.
For example, an issue would be created when all of the following conditions are met:

* You have a rule that alerts on critical vulnerabilities,
* The rule is associated with your JIRA alert profile,
* The Prisma Cloud scanner finds a critical vulnerability in an image in your environment.

=== Intelligent issue routing

You can leverage image labels to intelligently route alerts to the right team, and eliminate manual ticket triage.
For example, if team-a is responsible for image-a, and a vulnerability is found in image-a, you could set up the alert to flow directly to team-a's JIRA queue.

Intelligent routing depends on a Prisma Cloud feature called xref:../audit/annotate-audits.adoc#[alert labels], where you define labels that Prisma Cloud should watch.
When rules trigger, Prisma Cloud extracts the value of the label from the resource, and applies it to the next phase of alert processing.
For JIRA alerts, you can use labels to specify the JIRA project key, JIRA labels, and JIRA issue assignee.

For example, if you have an image with the following labels:

  group=front-end-group
  team=client-team
  business-app=my-business-app

You could configure Prisma Cloud to open issues about this specific image in the JIRA project defined by the _group_ label.

[.task]
=== Create new alert profile

Create a new alert profile.

[.procedure]
. In *Manage > Alerts*, click *Add profile*.

. Enter a name for your alert profile.

. In *Provider*, select *JIRA*.


[.task]
=== Configure the channel

Configure the channel.

[.procedure]
. In *Base URL*, specify the location of your JIRA service.

. In *Credential*, select the API Token that you added in the *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store* page. 
+
For more information, see <<Managing Jira Authentication in Prisma Cloud>>.

. In *CA certificate*, enter a copy of the CA certificate in PEM format.

. In *Project key*, enter a project key.
+
Alternatively, you can dynamically specify the project key based on a label.
When an alert fires, the project key is taken from the label of the resource that triggered the action.
To do so, click *Select labels...*, and choose a label that you know will contain the project key.
If there are no labels in the drop-down list, go to *Manage > Alerts > Alert Labels*, and define them.

. Enter an issue type.

. Enter a priority.

. Enter a comma delimited list of JIRA labels to apply to the issue.
+
You can dynamically define the list from a label.
Click *Select labels...*, and select one or more labels.

. Enter an assignee for the new issue.
+
You can dynamically define the assignee from a label.
Click *Select labels...*, and select one or more labels.

. Click *Send Test Alert* to test the connection.

=== Managing Jira Authentication in Prisma Cloud  

To integrate Jira with Prisma Cloud, you must configure authentication using API tokens. Jira Cloud and Jira Data Center (DC) no longer support password-based authentication for REST API access. Instead:  

- Jira Cloud requires an API token generated from your Atlassian account.  
- Jira DC supports authentication using Personal Access Tokens.  

This section provides procedures for adding API tokens to the Credentials Store, updating existing credentials, and replacing credentials in Jira alert profiles.  

==== Adding API Tokens in Credentials Store for Jira DC Authentication

To integrate Jira DC with Prisma Cloud, generate a Personal Access Token in Jira, store it in the Credentials Store in Prisma Cloud, and use it when adding a Jira profile. 

Jira Data Center (DC) supports authentication with Personal Access Tokens instead of traditional passwords.
For more information, see link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/using-personal-access-tokens-1026032365.html[Using Personal Access Tokens].

To add an API token for Jira DC authentication, do the following:

. Navigate to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.  
. Click *Add Credential*.  
. In the *Create Credential* window, complete the following fields:  
   * **Name** – Enter a name for the credential.  
   * **Description** – Add a description.  
   * **Type** – Select *API token*.  
   * **Access Token** – Enter the API token (use the *Personal Access Token* created in Jira DC)  
. Click *Save* to store the credential.  

=== Adding API Tokens in Credentials Store for Jira Cloud Authentication

Jira Cloud requires an *API token* for authentication instead of traditional passwords. To integrate Jira Cloud with Prisma Cloud, generate an API token in Jira Cloud, store it in the Credentials Store in Prisma Cloud, and use it when adding a Jira profile. 

For more information on creating cloud token from your Jira Cloud account, see link:https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/[Manage API tokens for your Atlassian account]

To add an API token for Jira Cloud authentication, do the following:

. Navigate to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.  
. Click *Add Credential*.  
. In the *Create Credential* window, complete the following fields:  
   * **Name** – Enter a name for the credential.  
   * **Description** – Add a description.  
   * **Type** – Select *Basic authentication*.  
   * **Username** – Add the email address used for the Jira Cloud account.
   * **Password**: Enter the API token (use the *API token* created in Jira Cloud)  
. Click *Save* to store the credential.  

==== Updating Jira Cloud Credentials to Use an API Token  

Jira Cloud no longer supports basic authentication with passwords. If you previously stored Jira Cloud credentials using a password, you must update the credential by replacing the password with an API token.  

To update Jira Cloud credentials, do the following:  

. Navigate to *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store*.  
. Select the Jira Cloud credential in the table, and click the *Edit* icon.  
. In the *Edit Credential* window, update the following fields:  
   * **Password** – Replace the existing password with the API token generated in Jira Cloud.  
. Click *Save* to update the credential.  

==== Replacing Credentials in an Existing Jira DC Alert Profile  

When updating Jira DC authentication, you must replace the old credential with a new API token in the existing Jira alert profile.  

To update the Jira DC alert profile with a new credential:  

. Navigate to *Manage > Alerts > Alert Profiles*.  
. Select the Jira alert profile you want to update and click the *Edit* icon.    
. In the *Settings* section, under *Credential*, select the API token that you added in the *Manage > Authentication > Credentials Store* page.  
. Click *Next* and then click *Save*.
